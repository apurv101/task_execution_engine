## Introduction

Amyable is a task automation application designed to perform tasks on a host machine by interpreting the current screen's state and executing the next set of actions. It leverages computer vision and natural language processing to understand the GUI elements and determine the appropriate actions to achieve the desired tasks.

---

## System Overview

The system comprises three main components:

1. **Desktop Application**: An executable running on the host machine where tasks are performed.

2. **Backend Server**: A RESTful API server that processes task descriptions and screenshots to determine the next actions.

3. **MongoDB Database**: Stores tasks, instructions, and action histories for the application.

The core functionality involves capturing the current screen, interpreting GUI elements using Google Vision and YOLO models, determining next actions using a Large Language Model (LLM), and executing those actions via `pyautogui`.

## Components Description

### Desktop Application

- **Function**: Retrieves pending instructions from MongoDB, captures screenshots, communicates with the backend server, and executes the received actions.

- **Technologies**:
  - Python
  - `pyautogui` for automating GUI interactions
  - MongoDB driver for accessing the database

- **Responsibilities**:
  - Retrieve the next pending instruction from the `instructions` collection.
  - Update the status of the instruction to "in-progress".
  - Capture the current screen state.
  - Send instruction IDs and screenshots to the backend server.
  - Execute actions received from the backend server.
  - Update the status of the instruction to "completed" or "failed" based on execution outcome.

### Backend Server

- **Function**: Processes incoming task descriptions and screenshots to generate the next actions, manages tasks and instructions in MongoDB.

- **Technologies**:
  - Python
  - FastAPI for building RESTful APIs
  - Google Vision API for text detection
  - YOLO model for object detection
  - OpenAI API for LLM integration
  - MongoDB for storing tasks, instructions, and action histories

- **Responsibilities**:
  - Receive task descriptions via API and create tasks and instructions.
  - Use LLM to break down tasks into instructions.
  - Store tasks and instructions in MongoDB.
  - Receive instruction IDs and screenshots from the desktop application.
  - Use computer vision to interpret GUI elements.
  - Utilize LLM to determine the next actions.
  - Update action history in MongoDB.
  - Respond with the next actions to the desktop application.

### MongoDB Database

- **Function**: Stores tasks, instructions, and action histories for the application.

- **Technologies**:
  - MongoDB
  - `motor` (async MongoDB driver for Python)

- **Responsibilities**:
  - Store main tasks with their descriptions and list of instruction IDs.
  - Store instructions with their descriptions, statuses, and action histories.
  - Provide efficient querying mechanisms for retrieving pending instructions.
  - Ensure data consistency and integrity.

---

## Workflow

### Adding a New Task

1. **Task Submission**:

   - The backend server receives a task description via the API.

2. **Task Decomposition**:

   - The backend server uses the LLM to generate instructions based on the main task description.

3. **Database Insertion**:

   - Inserts the main task into the `tasks` collection.
   - Inserts instructions into the `instructions` collection, referencing the `task_id`.

### Desktop Application Processing

1. **Instruction Retrieval**:

   - The desktop application queries the `instructions` collection to get the next instruction with `status: "pending"` for a specific `task_id`.
   - Updates the status of the instruction to "in-progress".

2. **Action Execution**:

   - The desktop application calls the backend server with the `instruction_id` and the current screenshot.
   - Executes the received actions using `pyautogui`.

3. **Instruction Completion**:

   - Updates the instructionâ€™s status to "completed" upon success or "failed" upon failure in MongoDB.

### Backend Server Interaction

1. **Action Generation**:

   - Upon receiving the `instruction_id` and screenshot from the desktop application, the backend server retrieves the instruction from the `instructions` collection, including its `action_history`.

2. **GUI Element Detection**:

   - Uses the Vision System to detect text (Google Vision API) and GUI elements (YOLO model) from the screenshot.

3. **Next Actions Determination**:

   - The LLM Interface processes the instruction description, detected GUI elements, and action history to generate the next actions.

4. **Action History Update**:

   - Updates the `action_history` for the instruction in the `instructions` collection.

5. **Response to Desktop Application**:

   - Sends the next actions back to the desktop application.
